# Day 6: Introduction

## Self Introduction

Hello and welcome to this React-TS Interviews course! My name is [Your Name], and I’m a frontend developer with several years of experience building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks like React.

## Course Introduction

This course is designed to help you master React and TypeScript through a series of interview challenges.

## Why This Course Is Needed

React and TypeScript are becoming increasingly important in the industry, and this course will help you stay ahead.

## Challenge Details:

🎯 Objective: Create an infinite-scrolling image gallery with proper loading states and error handling
🔑 Key Requirements:

Implement infinite scroll detection
Handle loading and error states
Manage image loading lifecycle
Preserve scroll position
Type-safe implementation

## 📋 Implementation Strategy:

## Set up state management:
typescriptCopyconst [state, setState] = useState<GalleryState>({
  images: [],
  isLoading: false,
  hasError: false,
  page: 1
});

Create intersection observer for infinite scroll:
typescriptCopyconst observer = useRef<IntersectionObserver>();

## Implement core functions:

handleScroll: Detect when to load more
loadMoreImages: Fetch next page
handleImageLoad: Track image loading
handleError: Error handling

## Build UI components:

Image grid layout
Loading indicators
Error messages



⭐ Success Criteria:

Smooth infinite scrolling
Proper loading states
Error handling
Type safety
Performance optimization

This challenge tests:
